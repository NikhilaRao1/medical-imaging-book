Chapter 1: Introduction to Medical Imaging
1.1 What Is Medical Imaging?
Medical imaging is the science and technology of visualizing the internal structures and functions of the human body for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and biomedical research. Rather than relying solely on physical examination or invasive procedures, medical imaging allows clinicians to observe anatomy and physiological processes noninvasively or minimally invasively.
Medical imaging plays a central role in modern healthcare. It supports early disease detection, guides surgical and interventional procedures, and enables longitudinal monitoring of disease progression and treatment response. Beyond clinical use, imaging technologies are also essential tools in biomedical research, helping scientists study biological structures and processes in vivo.

1.2 Goals of Medical Imaging
The primary goals of medical imaging include:
Visualization of anatomy: Identifying the size, shape, and structure of organs and tissues


Functional assessment: Measuring physiological processes such as blood flow, metabolism, or neural activity


Disease detection and diagnosis: Identifying abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, or lesions


Treatment guidance: Assisting in surgical planning and image-guided interventions


Monitoring and follow-up: Tracking disease progression or treatment effectiveness over time


Different imaging modalities are designed to emphasize different goals, leading to trade-offs in resolution, contrast, speed, safety, and cost.

1.3 Overview of Major Imaging Modalities
Medical imaging encompasses a wide range of technologies. Some of the most commonly used modalities include:
X-ray Imaging and Computed Tomography (CT)
X-ray imaging uses ionizing radiation to produce projection images of internal structures, particularly useful for visualizing bones and dense tissues. Computed Tomography (CT) extends this principle by acquiring multiple X-ray projections and reconstructing cross-sectional images with high spatial resolution.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to image soft tissues with excellent contrast. MRI is particularly valuable for imaging the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and organs without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.
Ultrasound Imaging
Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to generate real-time images. It is widely used due to its safety, portability, and low cost, especially in obstetrics, cardiology, and point-of-care diagnostics.
Nuclear Medicine Imaging (PET and SPECT)
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) use radioactive tracers to image metabolic and functional processes. These modalities are especially useful in oncology, neurology, and cardiology.
Optical and Microscopic Imaging
Optical imaging techniques, including fluorescence microscopy and optical coherence tomography, are commonly used in biomedical research and certain clinical applications such as ophthalmology.

1.4 Medical Imaging as an Interdisciplinary Field
Medical imaging is inherently interdisciplinary, combining principles from:
Physics (radiation, electromagnetism, acoustics)


Engineering (signal processing, hardware design, image reconstruction)


Computer science (image analysis, machine learning, AI)


Biology and medicine (anatomy, physiology, pathology)


Advances in imaging technology often arise from collaboration across these disciplines.

1.5 Role of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and large language models (LLMs), has begun to transform medical imaging workflows. AI methods are used for image reconstruction, segmentation, classification, and decision support. In educational settings, AI can also assist with content generation, assessment, and personalized learning—motivating the development of interactive, AI-enhanced textbooks such as the one explored in this project.

1.6 Chapter Summary
This chapter introduced the purpose and scope of medical imaging, reviewed major imaging modalities, and highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the field. In the following chapters, we will explore the physical principles, instrumentation, and applications of individual imaging technologies in greater detail.
